> I like optimization of low-latency systems, numerical methods, and predictive modeling.  
> Junior Undergraduate, CS & Math @ UNCG.

### Core Engineering 
My primary focus is the intersection of hardware constraints and mathematical abstraction. 

* **Net-Latency-Lab (Honors Contract):**
    * C++23, AF_XDP.
    * Benchmarking user-space networking against standard BSD sockets on ARM.
    * Custom lock-free SPSC queues (std::atomic acquire/release) to decouple I/O from logging; CPU isolation/pinning.
* **Algorithmic Optimization:**
    * President of [UNCG Competitive Programming Club](github.com/etekmen13/uncg-cpc-f25).
    * ICPC Gold Medalist (Regionals).
    * Focus on graph theory, dynamic programming, and numerical stability.

### Research & Mathematics
* **Continual Learning (AI):**
    * *Publication:* "GEM-Style Constraints for PEFT  with Dual Gradient Projection in LoRA" (Accepted IEEE ICDM 2025 / NSF REU) (*Publishing in progress, link provided upon release*).
    * Implemented dual projected gradient descent on constrained Quadratic Programs, reducing projection time by ~10⁴x.
* **Mathematics:**
    * I like Group Theory and Analysis.
    * Currently developing a Rubik's Cube solver derived from first principles.
    * 2025 Putnam Competition Participant (score pending).

### Theoretical Interests & Modeling
I am interested in predictive modeling applied to complex systems, ranging from financial markets to civilizations.

* **Cliodynamics:** Statistical modeling of historical dynamics and governance stability.
* **Macro-Prediction:** Utilizing economic theory and geopolitical data to model state trajectory and market hedges.
* **Aspirations:** Quant Research, Systems Engineering, AGI/Robotics, or macro-scale economic simulation.

### Life
* **Music:** Former National Jazz Musician (NYO Jazz, Essentially Ellington Outstanding Soloist). Featured on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/6g1QbmASV17suaq6bawcV9)
* **Culinary:** I love to cook. Turkish, Japanese, and Indian cuisine. Learning Spanish. Attempting Veganism.
* **Philosophy:** Economic theory and governance models, metaphysics (I am a firm atheist/determinist), anthropology/sociology/psychology, I want to understand humans and their relationship to the Universe.
